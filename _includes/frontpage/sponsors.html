        <h3>The MathJax Sponsorship Program</h3>
        <p>
          The MathJax project was initiated in 2009 by Design Science, the American Mathematical
          Society (AMS) and the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) with the goal
          of creating a robust, easy-to-use, and universal solution for displaying high-quality
          mathematics online. From the beginning, MathJax was conceived as open-source software, on
          the principle that math display should be part of the common infrastructure of the web.
        </p>
        <p>
          Providing a universal solution for online math display requires a long-term
          commitment. Our users need MathJax to be reliable and easy to use, now and in the
          future. This requires a continuous and coordinated rapid response to browser updates and
          bugs, keeping up with the proliferation of tablets, smartphones, and ebook readers, and a
          consistent approach towards new functionality and performance improvements. All of this is
          important to the community, and requires dedicated time, effort, and money.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our founding sponsors have been very generous in providing funding; however, as more and
          more individuals and organizations are using MathJax and its benefit to the community is
          growing, its base of support grew via the Sponsorship Program.  To ensure the long-term
          stability of MathJax, we continuously reach out to the community and ask organizations to
          contribute to the MathJax project by becoming a
          <a href="#friends">Friend</a>,
          <a href="#supporters">Supporter</a>, or
          <a href="#partners">Partner</a>.
          <strong>All MathJax sponsors share a demonstrated and significant interest in the
          dissemination of mathematics on the web, in particular through the MathJax project and its
          activities.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Please feel free to <a href="mailto:info@mathjax.org">contact us</a> for any further
          information about the sponsorship program.
        </p>

        <h3>MathJax Friends</h3>
        <p>
          By becoming a MathJax Friend, organizations show the community that they support the goal
          of easy-to-use, high-quality mathematics display on the web for everyone, and are
          contributing in a very concrete way to help MathJax realize that goal. MathJax Friends
          will be listed on the MathJax Sponsors page.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Summary of Benefits:</i>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A name (with link) on the <a href="#sponsors">MathJax Sponsors page</a>.</li>
          <li>Use of the term “MathJax Friend” in corporate communications.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <i>Annual contribution:</i>
          <br>$500+</p>

        <h3>MathJax Supporters</h3>
        <p>
          MathJax Supporters make an important contribution to the project and demonstrate their
          commitment to a durable math display solution for the web. Upon joining, Supporters
          receive exposure on the MathJax website, Facebook page, and Twitter feed. This will alert
          their users to their interest in using the best math display technology to enhance their
          online viewing experience, and displays their support for a project benefitting the entire
          math, science, and education community.
        </p>
        <p>
          Supporters also receive informative quarterly reports giving insight into project
          timelines, development plans, and upcoming activities. These reports enable to better plan
          their use of MathJax to take full advantage of MathJax resources to benefit their users.
        </p>

        <p>
          MathJax Partners are a driving force behind the project. They are discussion partners in
          determining the long-term direction of the project, and through exclusive benefits, we
          seek to ensure that Partners can offer their readers the highest quality math display and
          user experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Partners receive priority support and consideration for enhancements through a dedicated
          technical contact. This technical contact will work to ensure that issues receive prompt
          attention and receive a timely resolution. The contact will also meet with Partners to
          understand their requirements, serve as a liaison to the technical team, and work with
          Partners to be sure their requirements are being addressed to the extent possible within
          resource and technology constraints.
