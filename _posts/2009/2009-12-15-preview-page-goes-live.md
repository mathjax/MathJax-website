MathJax development reached an important milestone with the introduction of an updated [Preview](/?page_id=13) showing MathJax in action.  The page uses a development version of MathJax, which is still changing rapidly, so don't be too surprised to encounter bugs.  But we hope you will agree that even at this early stage, the results are promising.

Implementation of the overall framework code, layout functionality and LaTeX support are mostly complete. Support for MathML, accessibility, cut and paste and the integration API is still to come.

We have begun setting up a developer site for MathJax at SourceForge, and will be integrating the two sites together in the next couple of weeks.  Documentation, sample code, and other technical information will follow.
