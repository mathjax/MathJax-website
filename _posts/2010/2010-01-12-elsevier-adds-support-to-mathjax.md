Elsevier, B.V. added its support to MathJax yesterday, giving further momentum to the project.  As one of the world’s leading publishers of science and health information, Elsevier serves millions of scientists, students and health and information professionals worldwide, publishing around 2,000 journals and close to 20,000 books and major reference works. "We are very pleased to welcome Elsevier as a MathJax Supporter, particularly given the volume of mathematics displayed on the web in their publications each year" said Robert Miner, MathJax project coordinator and Vice President of Research and Development for Design Science, Inc.
