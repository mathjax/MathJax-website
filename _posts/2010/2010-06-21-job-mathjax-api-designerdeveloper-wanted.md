A robust JavaScript API has always been envisioned as an important part of  MathJax. It will enable script in a web page to control equation features, allow dynamic interactive pages to be built using MathJax, and provide hooks for accessibility tools such as screen readers. We would also like to make this API an expandable standard that will allow other notations to be supported in future. ChemJax anyone?

We are looking for a highly skilled JavaScript programmer to lead this effort. Requirements include experience with JavaScript API design, JavaScript frameworks, general web technology, and a strong interest in mathematical notation. Knowledge of MathML and accessibility technology are definite plusses.

This is a paid contract position, part-time or full-time. We are also flexible on the length of the commitment. If you are interested, email [jobs@mathjax.org](mailto:jobs@mathjax.org "jobs@mathjax.org").
