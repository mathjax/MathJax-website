Project Euclid announced today that it has enabled MathJax for a set

of 20 journals, with more titles to be added on a regular basis. The

final goal is to use MathJax for mathematics rendering throughout

Project Euclid for metadata such as titles, abstracts and references.

"MathJax makes it easy to display beautiful math online," said David

Ruddy, Project Euclid lead at Cornell. "It has been difficult to

present math attractively and reliably on the Web. There are a number

of different methods in use, and browsers all behave differently with

each. Now, with MathJax, the display problem has been vastly

simplified and Project Euclid users will be able to see math the way

authors intended." (Quote taken from this Project Euclid [News Brief](http://projecteuclid.org/News#mathjax).)

Developed by Cornell University Library and jointly managed by Cornell

and Duke University Press, Project Euclid is an online information

community for mathematics and statistics resources. It contains over

100,000 scientific articles from independent and society journals, as

well as conference proceedings and monographs.

Project Euclid is one of the sponsors of MathJax. Support for

both MathML and LaTeX source files, as well as compatibility with all

modern browsers, helps Project Euclid to serve the needs of both

publishers and readers. A useful article, [MathJax Best Practices for

Publishers](http://projecteuclid.org/MathJaxBestPractices),  can also be found at projecteuclid.org.
