MathJax is experiencing a rapid growth in the domain of online learning resources. The MathJax CDN usage figures (see also [this News post](/mathjax-cdn-service-very-successful-2/) from June 2011)  indicate that the MathJax user base is growing and diversifying, particularly in the domain of online learning resources. These range from online math encyclopedias to integrated course material, and from online math quizzes to test preparation services.

Motivated by this rapid uptake, we have looked deeper into how MathJax is being used by the e-learning community and released an article that describes this on mathjax.org. Please read ["Mathematics E-learning Community Benefits from MathJax"](/article-about-mathjax-in-e-learning-websites-released/) to learn more about the landscape of mathematical e-learning websites, and to understand how MathJax is helping online educators to teach mathematics on the web.
