AIP Publishing, a division of the American Institute of Physics, has announced today that it has become a MathJax partner, providing major funding and using MathJax to render mathematics in its online journals.

The American Institute of Physics is an organization of 10 physical science societies, representing more than 135,000 scientists, engineers, and educators and is one of the world's largest publishers of scientific information in physics. AIP pursues innovation in electronic publishing of scholarly journals and offers full-solution publishing services for its Member Societies. AIP publishes 13 journals; two magazines, including its flagship publication Physics Today; and the AIP Conference Proceedings series. 

“Both our reader and author communities will benefit greatly from AIP’s use and support of MathJax,” said AIP Director of Business Development Terry Hulbert. “The MathJax project is an important step forward, not only in the clarity with which it displays math, but in the usability and accessibility of math and online learning. AIP is proud to support the MathJax project.”

“AIP’s use and financial support of MathJax is a huge boost to the project,” said Robert Miner, MathJax Project Director. “This will significantly increase awareness and hopefully attract more support for MathJax.”

MathJax lets users copy equations from AIP’s online journal articles and paste them directly into Word and LaTeX documents, science blogs, MathType, and research wikis. Equations can also be copied and pasted into calculation software like Maple, Mathematica, and others. MathJax supports the use of STIX fonts (stixfonts.org), which will improve MathJax’s speed when rendering mathematics.

AIP is seeking feedback from the scientific community on the utility of MathJax as it continues to develop the service. To see MathJax in action, visit the 50th Anniversary issue of the Journal of Mathematical Physics ([jmp.aip.org/resource/1/jmapaq/v51/i1](http://jmp.aip.org/resource/1/jmapaq/v51/i1)). Every article in the issue is freely available. Select _read online _for any article, and once in the HTML view, go to the navigation bar and turn on MathJax.
