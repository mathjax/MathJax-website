IOP Publishing, ([ioppublishing.org](http://ioppublishing.org/)) continues to support the MathJax project as a MathJax Supporter, demonstrating its commitment to being a partner to the science community.

The Institute of Physics ([IOP](http://iop.org)) is a leading scientific society promoting physics and bringing physicists together for the benefit of all. IOP Publishing is central to the Institute of Physics, providing publications through which leading-edge scientific research is distributed worldwide. MathJax was first implemented on IOP Publishing’s journals platform [IOPscience](http://iopscience.iop.org/) in September 2011, enabling researchers to clearly view mathematics on more than 60 journals. The integration is part of IOP Publishing’s Article Evolution programme, a long-term project to improve the online delivery of research articles.

Julian Norman, Product Manager of the IOPscience platform, said, "With each version MathJax continues to offer more value to our users and we're delighted with the functionality provided to readers of content on IOPscience. We're very pleased to continue to support the MathJax project."

We look forward to continuing the collaboration with IOP, and welcome their ongoing support for the MathJax project.
