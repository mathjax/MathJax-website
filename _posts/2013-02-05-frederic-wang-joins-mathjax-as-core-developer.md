We’re very happy to announce that Frédéric Wang has joined the core development of MathJax.

If you don't know him by now, [Frédéric Wang](http://www.maths-informatique-jeux.com/blog/frederic/) has been our testing engineer for two years and developed and maintains [the MathJax testing framework](https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax-test). Frédéric has been active in the [Firefox's MathML project](https://wiki.mozilla.org/MathML:Home_Page) since 2007 and has worked closely with the W3C Math Working group. He also recently graduated with an M.S. in Mathematics from Pierre and Marie Curie University, Paris.

We’re excited that Frédéric is joining MathJax and we look forward to a productive 2013.

The MathJax Team.
