[Cambridge University Press](http://cambridge.org) is boosting MathJax by joining our sponsorship program as [MathJax Supporter](http://www.mathjax.org/sponsors/#supporters). Cambridge University Press is the publishing business of the University of Cambridge, dating back to 1534.

Cambridge University Press published its first book in 1584 making it the oldest publishing house in the world. Its peer-reviewed publishing lists comprise over 45,000 titles covering academic research, professional development, over 300 research journals, school-level education, written by authors in over 100 different countries. [Cambridge Journals](http://journals.cambridge.org/) publishes over 300 peer-reviewed journals, including journals published on behalf of over 100 learned societies, and employs MathJax to deliver beautiful, accessible mathematics in its journals.

Chris Fell, Digital Publishing Director, Cambridge University Press, comments, “As one of the premier publishers in mathematical science Cambridge University Press strives for the optimal presentation of mathematics, for example using TeX and LaTeX since the early 1980's. We are pleased to enable the use of MathJax across our publishing and to become a formal supporter of the project.”

Becoming a MathJax Supporter enables Cambridge University Press to make optimal use of MathJax, and makes an important contribution to keeping MathJax the reliable, flexible and open technology for mathematics on the web.
