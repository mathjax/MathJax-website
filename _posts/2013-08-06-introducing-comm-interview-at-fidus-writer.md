Welcome to our first _COMM_ post!

_COMM_ posts will highlight news from around the MathJax community, such as [interesting projects using MathJax](http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/misc/mathjax-in-use.html), development updates from the team, and tips &amp; tricks from the [MathJax User Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mathjax-users). You can follow the _COMM_ posts [here on site](http://www.mathjax.org/news/) or via our social media channels and [RSS](http://www.mathjax.org/feed.xml).

To hit things off, check out [Fidus Writer](http://fiduswriter.com/), an open source, web based editor for collaborative academic writing. They recently interviewed Peter on all things math-on-the-web and it's now available [on their blog](http://fiduswriter.com/2013/08/06/math-in-the-browser/).
