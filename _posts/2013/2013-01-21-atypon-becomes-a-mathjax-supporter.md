[Atypon](http://www.atypon.com/) is giving the MathJax project a boost by joining the sponsorship program as a MathJax Supporter. Atypon is a leading provider of Software as a Service content delivery for publishers. Beyond the welcome financial support, we are very pleased to have the benefit of Atypon's experience and leadership in STM publishing.

Atypon's [Literatum](https://www.atypon.com/products/literatum/) platform is used to deliver more than 14 million journal articles and 70,000 eBooks, using MathJax to render mathematical content at the highest quality, across all platforms and browsers. Kevin Cohn, Chief Operating Officer, comments "We’re pleased to support and promote MathJax as a key element in delivering the best possible content delivery solution for scientific, technical, engineering, and mathematics publishers". MathJax will benefit from suggestions and bug reports from Atypon's technical staff and we look forward to further collaboration.

Becoming a MathJax Supporter helps Atypon to make optimal use of MathJax, and also makes an important contribution to keeping MathJax a reliable, flexible and open technology.
