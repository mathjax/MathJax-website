[Stack Exchange](http://stackexchange.com) continues its support as a MathJax Partner, demonstrating its commitment to being a partner to the math and science community on the web.

The continuously growing Stack Exchange network currently consists of 104 communities, each dedicated to serving experts in a specific field. Of these, 18 Stack Exchange sites offer MathJax support, including [Mathematics Stack Exchange](http://math.stackexchange.com), [Cross Validated](http://crossvalidated.com) and [Electrical Engineering Stack Exchange](http://electronics.stackexchange.com).

David Fullerton, Vice President of Engineering, comments: "MathJax is an invaluable tool in our communities, and it continues to get better every year. We're happy to renew our support for MathJax, and we look forward to working together to improve mathematical, technical, and scientific discussion on the web."

MathJax continues to benefit from Stack Exchange's help with pre-release testing and we're grateful to get the feedback from their technical team as well as the community which keeps MathJax flexible, open and robust.

We look forward to continuing the collaboration with Stack Exchange, and welcome their ongoing support for the MathJax project.
