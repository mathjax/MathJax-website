MathJax is pleased to announce that [The Optical Society](http://www.osa.org) (OSA) has renewed its sponsorship of the MathJax project as a [MathJax Supporter](http://www.mathjax.org/sponsors/#supporters).

OSA has been the nexus for innovation in optics and photonics since 1916. Through its high-quality content, more than 180,000 scientists, PhD students and business leaders from 175 countries gain the confidence needed to power studies, shape real-world applications and accelerate achievements in the field. By supporting web-friendly HTML and MathML standards and using MathJax to display high-resolution, fully scalable symbols and mathematical equations, OSA enables its readers to access its journal content  on a wide variety of devices.

“As we see meaningful software releases and interact with the responsive MathJax team, our confidence in MathJax continues to grow. Online math display with MathJax is the right solution for our industry,” comments Scott Dineen, OSA Senior Director of Publishing Production and Technology.

The MathJax team looks forward to continuing the collaboration with OSA and welcomes their ongoing support for the MathJax project.
