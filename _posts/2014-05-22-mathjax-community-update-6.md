It's been too long since the last community update -- let's jump right in!

### MediaWiki Math Extension 2.0 released

Moritz Schubotz announced the official release of v2.0 of the [Math extension for MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Math). New features include SVG and MathML generation, mathoid and LaTeXML integration, display style math support, id's in math, as well as experimental MathML and Asciimath input.

### LaTeXML 0.8 released

The biggest news for LaTeX users who want to produce HTML is certainly that LaTeXML has finally, officially, irrevocably reached [version 0.8](http://dlmf.nist.gov/LaTeXML/).

### AH Formatter 6 with MathML support

[Antenna House](http://antennahouse.com/) has released a [MathML add on](http://antennahouse.com/xslfo/mathml-conformance.htm) to AH Formatter v6.

### _air mozilla_ talk on MathML accessibility

Mozilla intern Jonathan Wei gave a [talk on _air mozilla_](https://air.mozilla.org/mathml-accessability/) about the state of Gecko/Firefox MathML accessibility support.

### Letsfeedback now with live MathJax preview

[Letsfeedback has updated](http://letsfeedback.tumblr.com/post/78648922575/new-letsfeedback-release-now-online) their MathJax integration to include live preview functionality.

### Mobile apps

Xcas Pad, the Android and iOS ports of the [Xcas/Giac](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xcas) computer algebra system, are now [open source, hosted on github](https://github.com/xcaspad).

Steven Waldrip let us know that he published two new, free Truss apps, [Auto Truss -- Hand Calcs](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sw.structural.truss) and [3D Truss -- Hand Analysis](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sw.structural.truss3d), which help solve statically determinate or indeterminate truss on a two dimensional plane.

### New MathJax plugins: Gitbook, jemdoc, KARAS, JotForm

[Gitbook](http://www.gitbook.io/), the NodeJS app for building beautiful books using Git and Markdown, now comes with a [default MathJax plugin](https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook#default-plugins). Also check out this great example for [Gitbook with R Markdown](http://jason.bryer.org/Rgitbook/index.html).

Wonseok Shin has [integrated MathJax](http://www.stanford.edu/~wsshin/jemdoc+mathjax.html) into [jemdoc](http://jemdoc.jaboc.net/), the lightweight markup language / Python static-site generater developed by Jacob Mattingley.

The lightweight markup language developed by [KARAS](http://lightweightmarkuplanguage.com/index.html) ([translation](http://translate.google.com/translate?u=http%3A%2F%2Flightweightmarkuplanguage.com%2Findex.html&amp;hl=en&amp;langpair=auto|en&amp;tbb=1&amp;ie=UTF-8)) adds some interesting ideas to the markup mix -- and its JavaScript implemention comes with a [MathJax plugin](https://github.com/KARAS-LightweightMarkupLanguage/KARAS_MathJaxPlugin).

WYSIWYG form builder [JotForm](http://www.jotform.com/) now provides a [MathJax plugin](http://widgets.jotform.com/widget/mathjax) so that you can include mathematical content in a form.

### Angular.js and MathJax

[At the DataCamp blog](http://blog.datacamp.com/mathjax-binding-in-angular-js/), Dieter de Mesmaeker wrote a short post about combinging [Angular.js](https://angularjs.org/) with MathJax. You can also find good resources on Angular and MathJax over on Stackoverflow, e.g. [this answer](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16087146/getting-mathjax-to-update-after-changes-to-angularjs-model).

### Equation editors for Chrome

[ilovefreesoftware](http://www.ilovefreesoftware.com/19/featured/math-equation-editor-extensions-for-google-chrome.html) has a nice overview over equation editors in the Chrome extension store.

### Websites and webapps

Last but not least, here are some sweet examples of sites and apps leveraging MathJax.

*   [Puzzlet](http://puzlet.com/) is a new platform for browser-based scientific computing, using their own flavor of CoffeeScript. For some MathJax examples, see this [block diagram](http://puzlet.com/m/b00b1) or the [blab about SVG integration](http://puzlet.com/m/b00b3).
*   [praczone](http://www.praczone.com/) wants to help people learn math interactively. It provides a clean interface to organize lessons and exercises, neatly organized and easily edited.
*   [fisicalab](http://www.fisicalab.com/) provides a wealth of physics resources in Spanish, beautifully presented.
*   Numerical.pk `http://www.numerical.pk/Home.aspx` offers a educational resources for Pakistani students*   [Michal Pešta](http://www.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~pesta/) has a great example of using Knitr to write on [Survival data analysis](http://www.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~pesta/NMFM404/survival.html).
*   [Ex Libris](http://nonagon.org/ExLibris/) provides some great content examples such as this piece on the [Fast Fourier Transform](http://nonagon.org/ExLibris/gauss-fast-fourier-transform)
*   [The book of proof](http://www.bookofproofs.org/) collects [mathematical proofs](http://www.bookofproofs.org/branches/why-is-it-impossible-to-divide-by-0/), written, vetted, and ranked by its users.
*   At [Mathématique du secondaire](http://xavier.hubaut.info/coursmath/), Xavier Hubaut, emeritus of Université Libre de Bruxelles, collects wonderful [short articles](http://xavier.hubaut.info/coursmath/pol/snub.htm) on mathematical concepts.
*   [Mathster](http://www.mathster.com/) offers a comprehensive mathematics assessment package for  schools and teachers using the UK maths curriculum.
