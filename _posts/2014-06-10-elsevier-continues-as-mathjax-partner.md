[Elsevier](http://www.elsevier.com) continues to support the MathJax project as a MathJax Partner.

Elsevier is a world-leading provider of information solutions for science, health, and technology professionals. Elsevier provides web-based, digital solutions — among them ScienceDirect, Scopus, Elsevier Research Intelligence, and ClinicalKey — and publishes nearly 2,200 journals, including The Lancet and Cell, and over 25,000 book titles, including a number of iconic reference works. Through the Article of the Future program, Elsevier is advancing the format of the scientific article in very domain-specific ways to adapt to the needs of researchers in the digital age. By incorporating MathJax on [ScienceDirect](http://www.sciencedirect.com/), Elsevier enables highest quality rendering of mathematical and scientific content on one of the largest publishing platforms.

Christopher Greenwell, Publishing Director Mathematical Sciences, comments: “Elsevier is delighted to continue supporting MathJax as part of our ongoing commitment to providing the mathematical sciences community with high-quality products and services. Employing MathJax is one of the ways in which we are continuously improving the online article presentation on ScienceDirect with the aim of offering a superior online reading experience by enriching usability and quality of content.”

"Elsevier has supported MathJax since the inception of the MathJax sponsorship program.", said Peter Krautzberger, MathJax manager. "Thanks to this continued support we can improve MathJax long-term, working towards making mathematical and scientific content a first class citizen on the web."

We look forward to continuing the collaboration with Elsevier and welcome their ongoing support for the MathJax project.
