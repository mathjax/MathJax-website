[Cambridge University Press](http://cambridge.org) continues to support the MathJax project as a MathJax Supporter.

Cambridge University Press dates from 1534 and is part of the University of Cambridge. Following the University's mission, CUP works to disseminate knowledge in the pursuit of education, learning and research at the highest international levels of excellence. The publishing program of CUP comprises of over 45,000 titles by authors from over 100 countries. [Cambridge Journals](http://journals.cambridge.org/) employs MathJax to deliver high-quality, accessible mathematics in over 300 peer-reviewed journals.

"Cambridge is providing more and more of its content digitally and MathJax helps us ensure that our key titles in Mathematics are well displayed." said Chris Fell, Digital Publishing Director at Cambridge University Press.

“As a MathJax sponsor, CUP provides the MathJax team with important support and feedback for our development,” comments Peter Krautzberger, MathJax manager. “Thanks to dedicated sponsors like CUP, we can keep MathJax the high-quality, reliable, and flexible rendering solution it is today.”

We look forward to continuing the collaboration with CUP, and welcome their ongoing support for the MathJax project.
