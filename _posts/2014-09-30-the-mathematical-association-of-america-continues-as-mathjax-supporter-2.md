[The Mathematical Association of America (MAA)](http://www.maa.org/) continues to support MathJax as a MathJax Supporter.

The [MAA](http://www.maa.org) is the largest professional society focused on mathematics accessible at the collegiate level. As an early adopter of the web, the MAA has led the way communicating mathematics online including resources such as [MathDL](http://mathcomm.org/), [born-digital ebooks](http://www.maa.org/publications/ebooks/calculus-modeling-and-application-2nd-edition) and [journals](http://www.maa.org/publications/periodicals). The MAA's open-source homework system [WeBWorK](http://webwork.maa.org/) is used at over [500 institutions worldwide](http://webwork.maa.org/wiki/WeBWorK_Sites#.UjkYtd_ZXZg).

"The MAA is very pleased to support the continuing development of MathJax," says Ivars Peterson, MAA Director of Publications. "MathJax is a key resource for the MAA website and in other ventures in electronic publishing, all vital elements in the communication of mathematical knowledge."

"The support of dedicated sponsors such as the MAA ensures that we can continue to provide the high-quality, universal solution that MathJax has become," says Peter Krautzberger, MathJax Manager. "The MAA’s extensive experience and leadership in mathematical publishing and online technologies helps us improve MathJax with high-quality feedback, to the benefit of the entire community."

The MathJax team looks forward to continuing the collaboration with the MAA and welcomes their ongoing support for the MathJax project.
