[Stack Exchange](http://stackexchange.com) continues to support the MathJax project as a MathJax Partner.

Stack Exchange provides an ever-growing network of online communities, each dedicated to serving experts in a specific field. Among the 118 Stack Exchange sites, 26 integrate MathJax support to provide easy authoring and flawless rendering of mathematical content, including [Mathematics Stack Exchange](http://math.stackexchange.com), [Physics Stack Exchange](http://physics.stackexchange.com) and [Math Educators Stack Exchange](http://matheducators.stackexchange.com/).

"MathJax continues to be an essential part of our math, tech, and science communities," said David Fullerton, Vice President of Engineering. "We've been excited in the last year to work even more closely with the MathJax team to provide feedback and improve the MathJax engine. We look forward to continuing this partnership into the next year."

MathJax development greatly benefits from Stack Exchange's assistance with pre-release testing and we're grateful to get rich feedback from their technical team as well as the community to ensure that MathJax flexible, open and robust.

We look forward to continuing the collaboration with Stack Exchange, and welcome their ongoing support for the MathJax project.
