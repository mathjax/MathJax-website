Mathjax is pleased to announce that [AIP Publishing](https://publishing.aip.org) and the [American Institute of Physics](http://aip.org) have reaffirmed their commitment to MathJax in the form of a renewed financial contribution for 2014.  AIP Publishing provides the global physical science community with a comprehensive collection of highly cited peer reviewed scientific information. Accessed by researchers at nearly 4,000 institutions worldwide, AIP Publishing's portfolio of 17 journals includes prestigious titles such as Applied Physics Letters, Journal of Applied Physics, and The Journal of Chemical Physics, and the AIP Conference Proceedings series. AIP Publishing also publishes on behalf of several of AIP's Member Societies and other publishing partners.

As a federation of 10 physical science societies, The American Institute of Physics (AIP) pursues a mission to advance and distribute the knowledge of the physical sciences and its applications. AIP Member Societies collectively represent more than 120,000 scientists, engineers, educators and students in the global physical sciences community.

“The continued support of AIP Publishing demonstrates its commitment to being a partner to the science community”, comments Peter Krautzberger, MathJax manager. “The feedback of sponsors such as AIP is invaluable to ensure that MathJax remains the reliable, high-quality rendering solution it is today.”

“We believe MathJax provides a valuable service to researchers in the physical sciences by taking the worry out of accurately displaying and easily sharing the mathematical equations that are so important to the research they do,” said John Haynes, CEO of AIP Publishing.

We look forward to continuing the collaboration with AIP, and welcome their ongoing support for the MathJax project.
