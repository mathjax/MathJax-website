[The MathWorks](http://www.mathworks.com) continues to support MathJax as a MathJax Supporter.

The MathWorks provides the fundamental tools for research and development in academia and industry. Its leading computing software products, [MATLAB](http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/) and [Simulink](http://www.mathworks.com/products/simulink/), help engineers and scientists worldwide to accelerate the pace of discovery, innovation, and development. From industries, such as aerospace and industrial automation, to technical fields, such as financial services and computational biology, to more than 5000 colleges and universities around the world, the tools support teaching and research in a broad range of technical disciplines.

“Through its innovative display engine, MathJax is providing a valuable service to academia and industry,” said Mary Ann Freeman, director of engineering, MATLAB Products, MathWorks. “We are pleased to continue our support of this important initiative, which is focused on bringing the power of mathematics to the web.”

“The continued support of the MathWorks demonstrates its commitment to being a partner to the math science community on the web”, comments Peter Krautzberger, MathJax manager. “The feedback from sponsors like MathWorks is invaluable to ensure that MathJax remains the reliable, high-quality rendering solution it is today.”

We look forward to continuing the collaboration with the MathWorks and welcome their ongoing support for the MathJax project.
