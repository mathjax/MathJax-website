[Oxford University Press](http://www.oup.com) (OUP) continues to support the MathJax project as a MathJax Supporter.

OUP, a department of [Oxford University](http://www.ox.ac.uk/), is the largest university press in the world, currently publishing over 6,000 titles in more than 40 languages each year. OUP's broad academic and educational spectrum includes dictionaries, journals, scholarly monographs, and schoolbooks. Beyond traditional publishing products, OUP provides services such as digital learning and assessment platforms as well as online research tools.

Richard O’Beirne, Digital Strategy Manager at OUP: “MathJax provides the perfect solution for display of mathematics in digital products – a simple integration, superb display, and a greatly enhanced user experience. We’re very happy to continue supporting MathJax, and to see such an active roadmap in areas such as semantics, accessibility and responsive display for mobile users.”

“Thanks to dedicated sponsors like OUP, we are able to maintain and enhance MathJax as the high-quality and universal rendering solution it is today,” comments Peter Krautzberger, MathJax manager. The productive feedback we receive from the team at OUP is invaluable in achieving our mission to make mathematics a first class citizen on the web.”

We look forward to continuing the collaboration with OUP, and welcome their ongoing support for the MathJax project.
