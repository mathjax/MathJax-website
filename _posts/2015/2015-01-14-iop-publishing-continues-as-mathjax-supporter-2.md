IOP Publishing is a subsidiary of the Institute of Physics, a leading scientific society promoting physics and bringing together around 50,000 physicists from all sectors worldwide. IOP Publishing provides a range of journals, ebooks, magazines, conference proceedings and websites for the scientific community. IOP Publishing combines the culture of a learned society with global reach and highly efficient and effective publishing systems and processes.

Julian Norman, Product Manager of the IOPscience platform, said, “We're continually impressed by the level of development of MathJax and we’re excited to see what new innovations in maths rendering that the project will produce in the future that we can offer to users of IOPscience. We’re very pleased to continue to support the MathJax project and it's aim to advance mathematical and scientific content on the web.”
