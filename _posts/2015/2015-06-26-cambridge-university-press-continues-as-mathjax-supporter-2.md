[Cambridge University Press](http://cambridge.org) continues to support the MathJax project as a MathJax Supporter.

With its first publication dating back to 1584, Cambridge University Press (CUP) is the oldest publishing house in the world. As part of the University of Cambridge. CUP follows the University's mission to disseminate knowledge in the pursuit of education, learning and research at the highest international levels of excellence. Today, CUP publishes 50,000 titles by authors from over 100 countries with platforms such as [Cambridge Journals](http://journals.cambridge.org/) leveraging MathJax to deliver high-quality, accessible mathematics in over 300 peer-reviewed journals.

"Cambridge University Press is very pleased to renew its support for MathJax," said Roger Astley, Publisher Mathematics, Cambridge University Press. "We are committed to providing research communities with high quality publications, and to improving the experience of reading mathematics online in whichever ways we can. MathJax already has a key role to play in how we achieve this at Cambridge, and we are delighted to see that it continues to develop strongly.

“Dedicated sponsors like CUP help ensure the continuous development of MathJax”, comments Peter Krautzberger, MathJax manager. “Thanks to the support and feedback from the team at CUP we can keep MathJax the high-quality, reliable, and flexible rendering solution it is today.”

We look forward to continuing the collaboration with CUP, and welcome their ongoing support for the MathJax project.
