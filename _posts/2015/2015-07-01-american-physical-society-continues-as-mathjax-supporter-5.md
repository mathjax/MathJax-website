The [American Physical Society](http://www.aps.org/) (APS) continues to support the MathJax project as a MathJax Supporter.

Founded in 1899, the American Physical Society (APS) is the world's largest organization of physicists and involved in several activities to advance and diffuse the knowledge of physics, including a strong publication program with landmark titles such as Physical Review Letters, the Physical Review journals, and Reviews of Modern Physics. As an influential supporter of SGML-based math notation in the 1990s and an early adopter of MathML, the APS has long been furthering innovation in academic communication.

"This past year we were able to create a high-quality, HTML rendering of our journal articles, which are often math intensive. MathJax along with the web version of the STIX fonts created by the MathJax team are key pieces of the implementation.", said Mark Doyle, Chief Information Officer, American Physical Society. "After many years of work, it is gratifying to see the MathJax, JATS XML, and STIX efforts come together so seamlessly. MathJax also works quite well with our website's respocd cnsive design for a first rate mobile experience."

"Thanks to the dedication of sponsors such as APS, MathJax continues to deliver a reliable, high-quality solution for math and science on the web.", comments Peter Krautzberger, MathJax manager. "As one of the original MathJax sponsors, APS's support and feedback keeps pushing our development at MathJax forward."

We look forward to continuing the collaboration with APS, and welcome their ongoing support for the MathJax project.
