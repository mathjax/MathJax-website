[Elsevier](http://www.elsevier.com) continues to support the MathJax project as a MathJax Sponsor.

Elsevier is a world-leading provider of information solutions for science, health, and technology professionals. Elsevier provides web-based, digital solutions — among them ScienceDirect, Scopus, Elsevier Research Intelligence, and ClinicalKey — and publishes over 2,600 journals, including The Lancet and Cell, and more than 33,000 book titles, including a number of iconic reference works.  Elsevier is actively advancing discipline-specific content, format, and tools to the author and user needs and workflow.

“Our continued support of MathJax confirms our aim to improve ease-of-use of the research we publish,” said Paul Mostert, Head of Content Management of Elsevier’s Research Applications and Platform Division. “By incorporating MathJax on ScienceDirect, readers find mathematical elements displayed natively in Elsevier journals improving the readability and interpretation of the research.”

"As one of the original MathJax sponsors, Elsevier's support and feedback keeps pushing our development at MathJax forward.", said Peter Krautzberger, MathJax manager. "Thanks to this continued support we are able to keep MathJax the most reliable, high-quality solution for math and science on the web."

We look forward to continuing the collaboration with Elsevier and welcome their ongoing support for the MathJax project.
