[Springer Science+Business Media](http://www.springer.com/) continues to support the MathJax project as a MathJax Supporter.

As a leading global scientific publisher, Springer publishes 2,200 journals and over 8,000 new books each year. Springer’s open access platforms [Springer Open](http://www.springeropen.com/) and [BioMed Central](http://www.biomedcentral.com/) employs MathJax to provide accessible, high-quality display of mathematical and scientific content for over 240 open access journals.

“Advancing the reading experience of scientific material is extremely important to Springer and the work we do in the Technology team.”, says Rob Lloyd, Head of Front End, Springer London. “The accurate rendering of Mathematical equations is vital to our users and therefore to us. MathJax provides the most stable, accurate and performant method of displaying these equations and we are grateful for their continued hard work. Sponsoring MathJax is important to Springer as it will help to grow their community and fund their work an an extremely important area."

“Thanks to dedicated sponsors like Springer, we are able to develop MathJax continuously, keeping it the high-quality and universal rendering solution it is today,” comments Peter Krautzberger, MathJax manager. “In addition to its financial support, Springer provides the MathJax team with productive feedback that helps our development.”

The MathJax team looks forward to continuing the collaboration with Springer and welcomes their ongoing support for the MathJax project.
