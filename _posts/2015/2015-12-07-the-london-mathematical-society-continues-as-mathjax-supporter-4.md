The [London Mathematical Society](http://lms.ac.uk/) continues to support MathJax as a MathJax Supporter.

The London Mathematical Society (LMS) is the major UK learned society for mathematics with a nationwide and international membership. The LMS offers a rich publishing program, provides a diverse grant program, and organizes scientific meetings and lectures. Beyond that, the LMS  contributes to public debate on matters affecting mathematics and mathematics education.

"The London Mathematical Society provides full-text MathJax-rendered HTML on five of its journals and is currently implementing this feature on a sixth journal." said Fiona Nixon, Executive Secretary, LMS. "While a successful implementation of MathJax depends not only on MathJax itself but also on the quality of the generated HTML, we recognise that development needs to continue in the quest to render mathematical web pages with the same fluidity and versatility as non-mathematical ones. The LMS is therefore proud to continue to support the development and enhancement of MathJax".

"It is the dedication of sponsors such as the LMS that allow for the continuous development of MathJax”, comments Peter Krautzberger, MathJax manager. “Thanks to the support from the LMS we can keep MathJax the high-quality, reliable, and flexible rendering solution it is”.

We look forward to continuing the collaboration with the LMS, and welcome their ongoing support for the MathJax project.
