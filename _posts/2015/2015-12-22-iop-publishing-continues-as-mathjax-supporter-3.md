[IOP Publishing](http://ioppublishing.org/) continues to support MathJax as a MathJax Supporter.

IOP Publishing is a subsidiary of the Institute of Physics, a leading scientific society promoting physics and bringing together around 50,000 physicists from all sectors worldwide. IOP Publishing provides a range of journals, ebooks, magazines, conference proceedings and websites for the scientific community. IOP Publishing combines the culture of a learned society with global reach and highly efficient and effective publishing systems and processes.

Dr Christopher Ingle, Content & Services Manager at IOP Publishing, said, "We are very pleased to continue our support of the MathJax project and its aim to advance mathematical and scientific content on the web. MathJax enables us to provide enhanced rendering of equations on our website IOPscience, in both our journal articles and book chapters. The MathJax team have provided valuable support to us in 2015 and we look forward to working with them to improve IOPscience in the future."

“Thanks to dedicated sponsors like IOP Publishing, we are able to maintain and enhance MathJax as the high-quality and universal rendering solution it is today,” commented Peter Krautzberger, MathJax manager. "The productive feedback we receive from the team at IOP Publishing is invaluable in achieving our mission to make mathematics a first class citizen on the web.”

We look forward to continuing the collaboration with IOP Publishing, and welcome their ongoing support for the MathJax project.
