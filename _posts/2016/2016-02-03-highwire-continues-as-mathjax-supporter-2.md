[The HighWire Open Platform](http://home.highwire.org/) provides innovative technology solutions to influential societies, university presses, and independent publishing organizations, assisting in the digital dissemination and readability of some of the most high-impact journals, books, and other scholarly materials on the net.

"Celebrating 20 years of service, HighWire Press, Inc. is excited to once again be a supporter of the initiatives behind the development of MathJax’s open source platform for display of mathematics,” said Christopher Abbott, Director, Content Service, HighWire Press. “The HighWire Open Platform is designed to work well with standards such as MathML. We’re proud to be part of the solution."
