[IEEE](http://www.ieee.org/) continues to support MathJax as a MathJax Partner.

With roots going back to 1884, IEEE is the world’s largest professional association with over 2,000 local chapters across the world. IEEE follows its mission to foster technological innovation and excellence for the benefit of humanity.  With more than 148 transactions, journals, and magazines as well as sponsoring for over 1,300 conferences, IEEE inspires as global community in electrical engineering, computer science and electronics. Its [_IEEEXplore®_ digital library](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/) provides web access to over three million technical documents with more than eight million downloads each month.

"Recognizing that MathJax has revolutionized the display of complex mathematics,  IEEE has enthusiastically supported the project from its inception," said Gerry Grenier, Senior Director of Publishing Technologies. "It is gratifying to see that MathJax continues to grow and comforting to know that the MathJax community is there to help us solve what sometimes are arcane math display issues."

“Thanks to the dedication of sponsors like IEEE, we are able to maintain and enhance MathJax as the high-quality and universal rendering solution it is today,” comments Peter Krautzberger, MathJax manager. "The rich feedback we receive from the team at IEEE is invaluable in achieving our mission to make mathematics a first class citizen on the web.”

We look forward to continuing the collaboration with IEEE, and welcome their ongoing support for the MathJax project.
