The [American Physical Society](http://www.aps.org/) (APS) continues to support the MathJax project as a MathJax Supporter.

Founded in 1899, the American Physical Society (APS) is the world's largest organization of physicists and involved in several activities to advance and diffuse the knowledge of physics, including a strong publication program with landmark titles such as Physical Review Letters, the Physical Review journals, and Reviews of Modern Physics. As an influential supporter of SGML-based math notation in the 1990s and an early adopter of MathML, the APS has long been furthering innovation in academic communication.

"APS is very pleased to continue our support of MathJax, both financially and through our participation on the new technical committee", said Mark Doyle, Chief Information Officer, American Physical Society. "Recent efforts on accessibility and the current work on updating the core of MathJax are exciting enhancements that will benefit all readers of math on the web."

"As one of the earliest MathJax sponsors, APS has helped push MathJax forward from Day 1.", said Peter Krautzberger, MathJax manager. "Thanks to their continued support we are able to keep MathJax the most reliable, high-quality solution for math and science on the web."

We look forward to continuing the collaboration with APS, and welcome their ongoing support for the MathJax project.
