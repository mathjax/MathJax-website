[AIP Publishing](https://publishing.aip.org/), a division of the American Institute of Physics, continues to support MathJax as a MathJax Supporter.

As a federation of 10 physical science societies, [The American Institute of Physics (AIP)](http://aip.org/) pursues a mission to advance and distribute the knowledge of the physical sciences and its applications. AIP Member Societies collectively represent more than 120,000 scientists, engineers, educators and students in the global physical sciences community.

AIP has been one of the world's leading publishers in the physical sciences for more than 80 years. AIP Publishing provides a comprehensive collection of highly cited peer reviewed scientific information.
