# New Features in this Release

<a id="sre"></a>
## Speech-Rule Engine

MathJax now integrates version 4 of Speech Rule Engine (SRE). ([#800](https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax-src/pull/800)) 

* SRE v4 is a full port to ES6 using TypeScript providing **transpiled JavaScript for easier integration** into third party projects via its npm package.
* Uses webpack as the primary bundler to offer a **single bundle file** for both node and browser.
* Major rewrite of rule handling and provision of locales.
    * Smaller locale files and memory footprint in the index structure.
    * Hierarchical locale setup that allows inheritance within rule sets.
    * **Uses ES6 promises** to handle locale loading and engine setup.
* A  number of **new locales** for Swedish, Norwegian (Bokmal and Nynorsk), Danish (MathSpeak only), and Catalan (MathSpeak only)
* Locale files are now served with a `.json` extension. (https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax/issues/2403)

For more details and a full list of all changes and additions [see the SRE release notes](https://github.com/Speech-Rule-Engine/speech-rule-engine/releases/tag/v4.0.0).

MathJax makes use of SRE v4 new features in the following ways:

* Source integration
     * Integrates SRE directly via importing the relevant library files into its code and webpacks them into its components and bundles.
     * Replaces the timeout-driven SRE loading promise with SRE's new native promises.
     * The `sre.ts` module now imports and exports exclusively API methods necessary for SRE's use in MathJax
     * A new `mathmaps.ts` module provides a map for directly integrating and bundling locales (see more below).
* Components integration
    * The `sre` component under `components/src/sre` now simply handles copying the locale files in the `mathmaps` directory.
    * The `a11y/sre` component under `components/src/sre` contains a configuration file `sre_config.js` that sets up the basic SRE configuration for MathJax, especially the correct path to the `mathmaps` folder (online or in the npm distribution).
    * Components can webpack SRE's locale files into bundles. See the `components/src/tex-chtml-full-speech` component as an example.
* MathJax Configuration
   * The `sre` path in MathJax is now used exclusively for pointing to a directory containing the locale files.

Most of these changes are internal and should remain unnoticeable. However, there are a couple of points to note when using SRE via MathJax:

* Previously, MathJax would load SRE as a single library file, but now webpacks its source files, which, as a side-effect, closes several convenient loopholes you could have exploited in the past:
    * **OLD**: SRE's functionality was available to a developer as if running SRE standalone. That is, in both node and browser, all of SRE's API methods where available in the `SRE` namespace, and additionally, the full functionality was reachable in the browser through the `sre` namespace.
    
      **NEW**: Now only the explicitly exported API methods are available to import via the `a11y/sre` component.
  
   * **OLD**: You could easily change the version of SRE MathJax would use by:
      1. In the browser, pointing to an alternative copy of `sre_browser.js` using the `sre` path in the MathJax configuration, and 
      2. In node, replacing the `speech-rule-engine` package with a different version in the `node_modules` folder.

     **NEW**: This is no longer possible.
    
* The `sreReady` method is still exported but _deprecated_. In the future, you should use the corresponding method in the API bundle `Sre.sreReady()`.
* By default SRE comes without rules (or locales) preloaded, and pulls those in only when necessary. That is, it loads the relevant `.json` files via XML-HTTP-request in the browser, or via file loading in the node module. However, it is now possible to pre-bundle (some) locales directly into a custom distribution using webpack, which is particularly useful if you want to run MathJax offline while still using the full power of is assistive technology extension. See the `tex-chtml-full-speech` component as an example.

<a id="available"></a>
# Availability of version 3.2.1

Although version 3.2.1 was released earlier today, it may take a day or two for the new version to propagate to the various CDN network computers, so you may not see v3.2.1 immediately if you are loading mathjax using a generic `mathjax@3` URL.  You should be able to obtain it immediately if you use the full version `mathjax@3.2.1`.

You may also have a cached version in your browser, so you may need to either clear the browser cache, or relaunch your browser (or both) in order to get the latest version (the cached version should expire in about a week, depending on the CDN being used).

Note that it is possible for some files to be updated before others, so it may be the case that users of websites that load extensions (either explicitly or by autoloading TeX packages) may get mixed versions until the CDN versions stabilize, which should be within a day.  If you are loading one of the combined components (e.g., `tex-chml.js`), this is less likely to be an issue, and if you are loading a component ending in `-full` it is even less likely to occur.

Version 3.2.1 is available immediately from npm and GitHub for use in node applications.
